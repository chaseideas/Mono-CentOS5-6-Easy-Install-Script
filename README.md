Mono-CentOS5-6-Easy-Install-Script
==================================

Deployment install script for Mono on CentOS 5 and CentOS 6 Minimal installs

1. Download script "wget http://raw.github.com/chaseideas/Mono-CentOS5-6-Easy-Install-Script/master/mono.sh" 
	(may need to install wget on minimal install; "yum install wget")
2. Run script "sh mono.sh"
3. ???
4. MONO!!

This script was created because the install process for Mono on CentOS is way more painful than it should be.
